  /* When the Lua side wants to execute something which would block
   * the event loop, it posts it as a request to one of the async
   * worker threads.
   *
   * Every module can define its request types in C code and register
   * the corresponding handlers with the async module by calling
   * zz_async_register_worker(). A worker is a group of handlers
   * registered in this way. Worker threads can be asked to execute
   * any handler provided by a registered worker.
   *
   * To make a request, the Lua side fills out the selected worker
   * thread's zz_async_worker_info structure with the worker_id,
   * handler_id and a pointer to a structure describing the request
   * (the layout varies by request type). The Lua side then fires the
   * worker thread's request_trigger - this wakes up the thread which
   * then looks up the desired handler and passes request_data to it.
   *
   * Before the request handler completes, it should store any return
   * values in the request_data structure. The worker thread then
   * fires response_trigger which is being polled on the Lua side in
   * the coroutine which is waiting for the completion of the async
   * request.
